Monday, September 24, 2018
    - Stylesheets
        - Switched stylesheets from .css.scss to just .scss to avoid "DEPRECATION WARNING: Extra .css in SCSS file is unnecessary" warnings.
    - Header
        - Fixed sign in/sign out button so you don't have to click the text for the button to work
        - Made logo larger than microscopic
        - Change standardperks_path????

Tuesday, September 25, 2018
    - Profile Page Header
        - Used CSS to crop and center user profile images. We should eventually switch to an uploader that can auto-crop or allow users to crop their own images.
        - Header is now responsive to browser size
        - Need Ruby logic to show genres and their commas only when present in the profileDescription span.
    - Profile Page Livestream
        - Tried to make Jitsi a responsive embed with Bootstrap but when I add the embed-responsive class to its iFrame with jQuery it disappears. I probably have to fix all the wrappers around it.
    - Profile Page Merchsidebar
        - Will retool as a Bootstrap panel
        
Thursday, September 27, 2018

        - Placeholder perks aren't gibberish anymore

        - Banner images are currently sized by flexbox, which means they look different at every browser size. Bad solution, but works until we get the uploader to allow cropping or enforce image dimension limit.
    - Merch Sidebar
        - It's a panel now, but it's taking awhile for me to work through the Ruby logic to style each if case.
        - The perks probably shouldn't be a table, but hey, what do I know! This is hard to read lol

Friday, September 28, 2018

        - Images uploaded from mobile are sideways. Bug reported in Issues.
        - Put in a lil' JavaScript to take the brightness of the profile banner and change the color of the user's name depending on it. Seems to only work once when a new image is loaded, then defaults to maroon after refresh. weeeeeird
    - Merch sidebar
        - Purchase button won't show up if user selling Perk doesn't have Stripe account

        - Moved Profile Title color javascript to a partial
    - Authorform
        - Default header image now has colored text over it so it's readable.
        - Instead of two line breaks between header and body, I added a margin-bottom. Sorry for cheating the first time!
        - May need to enable CORS so if someone updates their profile header in Heroku the javascript still works on CP.TV
    - Edit Profile
        - Rebuilt form
        - Add a Stripe section??
        - editingotemplate.html.erb is probably useless. Can be replaced with the login form template.

Tuesday, October 9, 2018
    - Create Perk
        - Name, price, and description are now all required in the HTML.
        - Still needs backend validation though!
        - Suggested Perks list now autofills the form fields in dumb JavaScript. I wanted to make it randomly choose suggestions from a list but it was taking too long.
    - /views/layouts
        - Deleted unused partial editinfoform; it was an old header on the edit profile page.
        - Almost deleted editinfoform template, but looks like it's important. I'll poke around on this one.
        - Deleted unused template homepg; I put the centering in home.scss instead of having a whole new template just to use the deprecated <center> tag.
    - Dashboard
        - Add merch sidebar? Edit rather than Buy buttons.
    - Home page
        - I made the buttons a smaller size since the old buttons get crushed in mobile view. I'll find a workaround eventually.

========================================
Tasks for Week of October 15th, 2018
    - Scrum Organization
        - Considering a merge into either Trello or Github Projects.
    - Files cleanup
        - Partial stylesheets are getting loaded into every file because of my file setup, so I'll have to do a lil' cleanup to fix.
        - Issues in Github can be ported over to our Trello/Projects so we can leave it for bugs.
        - Want to compress our templates into fewer files and delete unused files to reduce clutter in our file structure.

    - Jitsi Recording

        - Compressed our home page hero image because whooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa that's a big boy.
        - Margin above heroImage on Firefox is gone now.
    - Show page
        - Increased height of merchsidebar so it should match height of Jitsi player.
        - Chopped up the YouTube div. It's a well at the bottom for now, but later I'll hopefully make it replace the Jitsi player when not in use.
        - Clamped down overflowing banner images with a max-width.
        - Restyled Join Livestream button.
        - User banner, profile image, and name are all hidden if on Heroku. Kind of a lame workaround but it should prevent the page from scrolling up when text is entered in the Jitsi chat.
    - Sign In/Up
        - Sign Up now matches style of Sign In page. Bye bye, YouTube video.
        - Sign In has the form placed in a well so it doesn't look stranded.
    - Assets/Images
        - I moved some stuff out of the way. Then I added a bunch! Then I moved them again
    - Notes
        - Bio doesn't actually show up anywhere, I'll have to put it on the profile page.
        - The Sign Up page still has a ton of room for a sidebar with information we can add later.
        - Still need regex for commas after Genres on profile page
        
========================================
Tasks for week of October 29, 2018
    - Outlined profile name is too busy

        - Fix dashboard so it's the most-used page rather than the home page.
    - Paginate books index like the userswithmerch page.
    - Look through livestream sites ToS for terms on recording; non-members need a way to opt-in
